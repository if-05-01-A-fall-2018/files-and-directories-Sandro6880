1.FAT Main Memory Requirements: 

a)	250GB = memory = 268435456000 Bytes;
	1KB   = size = 1024 Bytes;

	memory / size = capacity -> 262144000
	A: The Disk has 262144000 Blocks.

b)	A: same as the blocks sizes.

c) 	log2(capacity) ~ 28 bit
	The table should be the size of 32 bit (rounding up).

d) 	(262.144.000 * 32)/ 8 = 1GB

2.Random Access of Files

a)	We have to go to a triple indirect block and calcualte
	the position from there.

b)	107.834.589 jumps are required to get to the desired block when
	we are starting from the beginning of the file.

3.UFS File Size i-node

	Since 4KB blocksize has 4 times the value of Block references than 1 KB blocksize
	the file is therefore 4 times smaller using the 1KB blocksize.

4.UFS File Size

a)	512 bytes would lead to a maximum of 1GB File size. Since we assume a file size of 5GB
	we have to switch.

b)	nothing would change, we still have to use the 1024 byte sized blocks. Since the required 
	12GB are under the max File size of ~ 17GB.
